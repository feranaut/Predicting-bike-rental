# Predicting-bike-rental

In this project, I'll predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour. I'll also predict the total number of bike rentals. To accomplish it, I'll create a few different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

I'll be working with a dataset that describes detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day from a communal bike sharing station in Washington D.C.
